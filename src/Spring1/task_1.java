     * Mortgage Payment, as we all know, is the amount of money that you need to return to the person or
     * entity where you have your property mortgaged with.
     * The frequency of the transaction is monthly and can be calculated with the help of a simple formula.
     *
     * The formula for Mortgage Payment is as follows:
     *
     * M = P [{r(1+r)^n}/{(1+r)^n â€“ 1}]
     *
     * where
     *
     * M = Monthly payment
     *
     * P = principal
     *
     * r = rate
     *
     * n = number of payments
